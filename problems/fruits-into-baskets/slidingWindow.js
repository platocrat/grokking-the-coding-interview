 *     Problem:   
 *      
 *        -  Given an array of characters where each character represents a
 *           fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your goal is to put
 *           maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction
 *           is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 *
 *        -  You can start with any tree, but once you have started you
 *           canâ€™t skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each tree 
 *           until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick 
 *           from a third fruit type.
 *          
 *        -  Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in 
 *           both the baskets.
 * 
 *     Difficulty:         (medium) 
 *        
 *        -  This problem is actually very similar to the
 *           longest-substring-with-k-distinct-characters problem.
 *           Actually, it is a reworded version of the same problem!
 *           We need to find the length of the longest subarray
 *           with no more than two distinct characters (or fruit types!).
 *           This transforms the current problem into a Longest
 *           Substring with K Distinct Characters where K = 2.
 *     
 *     Time Complexity:    O(N), where 'N' is the number of characters
 *                         in the input array.
 *          
 *           -  Outer for loop runs through all characters and the inner
 *              while loop processes each character once, therefore the 
 *              time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N + N), which
 *              is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).
 *
 *     Space Complexity:   O(1)
 *                
 *           -  There can only be a maximum of three types of fruits
 *              stored in the HashMap. This reduces to a constant of 1
 *              since the first derivative (or rate of change) of any
 *              constant variable is 1.
